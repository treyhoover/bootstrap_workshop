            <h2>The Sounds You Crave</h2>

            <p>We've spent the last 80 years developing state of the art, office simulation technology.
                From ringing and typing to antiquated machine sounds, we've got you covered.
                Heck, we even threw some children crying in there. Maybe it's Bring Your Child to Work day or
                something.</p>

                all.
                The office of the future lives in the cloud, so the stress of the office can stay with you all day
                long.</p>
